<h1>MOUNT EVERST</h1>

<p>Mount Everest is a peak in the Himalaya mountain range.<br>
     It is located between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China. 
     At 8,849 meters (29,032 feet),<br> it is considered the tallest point on Earth.<br>
      In the nineteenth century, the mountain was named after George Everest, a former Surveyor General of India.<br> 
      The Tibetan name is Chomolungma, which means<strong>“Mother Goddess of the World"</strong>.<br>
     The Nepali name is Sagarmatha, which has various meanings.</p>
     <div>The first ever recorded people to climb Everest were Edmund Hillary (a mountaineer from New Zealand) and his Tibetan guide Tenzing Norgay.<br>
         They climbed the mountain in 1953 and hold the record together.<br>
          The first records of Everest's height came much earlier, in 1856.<br>
           British surveyors recorded that Everest was the tallest peak in the world in their Great Trigonometrical Survey of the Indian subcontinent.</div>

           <p>The Himalayan mountains have long been home to indigenous groups living in the valleys.<br>
             The most famous of these are the Sherpa people.<div>The word “Sherpa” is often used to mean mountain guide, though it actually refers to an ethnic group.<br>
             The Sherpa have valuable experience in mountain climbing, which they can provide to other climbers. </div> 
              Most climbs of Everest would be impossible without the Sherpa's logistical help and knowledge. <br>However, their way of life extends beyond helping Everest climbers.<br>
               Traditionally, their lifestyle has consisted of farming, herding, and trade. And, because they live at such a high altitude year round, they are accustomed to the low oxygen levels.</p>
